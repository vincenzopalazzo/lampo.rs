## How to Install

To install all the requirements binary we need to 
have rust installed, and then run the following command

```
make install
```

After you have `lampod-cli` and `lampo-cli` available and the following
commands can be ran

```
➜  ~ lampod-cli --network signet
✓ Wallet Generated, please store this works in a safe way
 waller-keys  maple have fitness decide food joy flame coast stereo front grab stumble
```

N.B: Store your wallet works, and then reuse them to restore the waller with `--restore-wallet`.

Please note that this need to have a `lampo.conf` in the path `~/.lampo/signet`. See an example in lampo.example.conf

Then you can query the node with the following command 

``` 
➜  ~ lampo-cli --network signet getinfo
{
  "node_id": "035b889551a44e502cd0cd6657acf067336034986cd6639b222cd4be563a7fc205",
  "peers": 0,
  "channels": 0
}
```
